## Description
This project is a Resident Evil love letter, wanting to personally create my first game be an old Resident Evil type of game. All textures and assets are grabbed for free from the Unity Asset Store, but any edits to further the ambiance to fit my ideal is mine. The project has at the moment a hallway scene with a zombie that has pathfinding AI, a particle system for dust, an attached weapon to the character, two cameras to switch to, camera triggers and door triggers, a rudimentary menu UI, a pause screen, and another scene for a room that includes the same except for the enemy.
